## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit  
- **Backend API**: FastAPI  
- **NLP Models**:  
  - `SentenceTransformer` (SBERT) for semantic similarity  
  - `dslim/bert-base-NER` for named entity recognition  
  - GCN (PyTorch Geometric) for graph embeddings  
- **Database**: MongoDB (via Motor Async)  
- **AI API**: Google Gemini for keyword extraction  
- **OCR**: `pdfplumber` & `pytesseract` for text extraction from resumes
